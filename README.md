# Time Calculator

This is my solution to the Time Calculator project from the Scientific Computing with Python course on FreeCodeCamp.

## Description

The Time Calculator project is a Python script that helps you perform time calculations easily. It allows you to add or subtract a specified amount of time (in hours and minutes) to a given time. The program takes user input in the format of the start time, hours to add or subtract, and minutes to add or subtract. It then calculates the new time and displays the result.
